                        My name is Jamison Gordon. I was born to two parents, a mother and a father but they're not as important.
                        When I was a kid, I lived in Provo in a little yellow house. It was there that I indured the agony of my mom
                        running an in house daycare until I was thirteen years old. During this time, I began attending a stuffy
                        charter school filled with turds.

                    <div class="bio-second">
                        Since the charter school was K-12 I became immune to the smell. I was even able to make the best of it.

                        Along the way I was able to make some friends but shortly after I moved to Washington. I'm back now, though, so that's cool.
